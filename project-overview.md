# Project Overview

Project Name: Cringe Cinema

Description: A movie recommendation app themed around Reddit culture, showcasing films with an ironic and self-aware sense of humor. The "cringe" aspect is baked into the presentation and content.

*   Random Movie Generator: Chooses "best of the worst" based on algorithm.
*   Cringe-O-Meter: A visual gauge that rates a movie's "cringe" level based on mocked community feedback.

Target Audience: Users who appreciate internet humor, meme culture, and enjoy exploring so-bad-it's-good movies.

Technology Stack:
